# Introduction

Our project is aiming to be a PC-based game. With the concept of "First-Person RPG", we are looking for a dungeon-crawling experience where the player may, for example, open chests, find keys, and defeat enemies to advance from room to room and then level to level. There will be a focus on customization, where the player may have several classes to choose from like fighter, mage, or ranger. The ways in which they pass the level will entirely theirs to decide, with various weapons and spells. NPCs will exist to inform the player of lore and guide them to their goal. We're focusing on a medieval theme but could cross into modern or futuristic themes or settings. 

The concept for our group will be of an independent developer who is developing a game not for a direct customer ordering the software, but for an online game store like Steam or Epic. The game will have an indie feel; simple but effective artwork and character design with no pressure to create a game based strictly in realism or a game similar to an existing intellectual property.

# Anticipated Technologies

Technology required for the project will include an existing game engine such as Unity or Unreal and their respective editing programs. Access to a group meeting application such as Discord or Zoom. Likely something to design and create models, textures, etc. 

# Method/Approach

Our approach is encourage collaboration and take new ideas from everyone. Our image for this project is open-ended so we foresee several prototypes being made, reviewed, and either updated, changed, or thrown out. New features, weapons, enemies, or game rules will be tested and previewed amongst members for internal feedback.

# Estimated Timeline

Major milestones for this project will be: establishing basic game goals (find key to unlock door to advance? defeat all the enemies to advance? two-handed combat?) which should take a week to collaborate and finalize. Becoming familiar with Unity, our current choice for a game engine and editor, another week. Designing a model of our "tutorial level", another week. Designing the tutorial level within Unity, testing and garnering feedback, and redesigning should compromise the majority of our time, up to two or three weeks. Testing our program on various devices, testing for bugs, and finishing touches should last a final week.
Anticipating total project time to be 7-10 weeks.

# Anticipated Problems

Team members are not entirely familiar with C++ or Unity, so our success in development will depend on our success in understanding the language and editor.
Open-ended scope of the project could water-down the game concept, so we'll have to have a cohesive theme and adhere to it.
Group may not always be able to meet in-person, which will require online meetings and keeping an eye on Discord.
